# Image Processing Project - Poisson Image Editing
Image composition (collage) with Poisson blending.

#### Description
- Manually compose pieces from several images
- Automatically blend these pieces and produce an output image

#### Technologies
- Define regions of interest in each input image that need to appear in the final result
- Poisson blending, Edge detection/segmentation starting from several color images

#### Bonus targets
- Implement an intuitive GUI that lets users combine images in interesting ways.
- Explore video editing (only a few frames).
